# TensorFlow Project Scaffold

This project is meant to provide a starting point for new
TensorFlow projects.

Inspirations and sources:

- [generator-tf](https://github.com/jrabary/generator-tf/)

## Structure of the project

- `project`: project modules
- `experiments`: experiment scripts
- `configs`: experiments configuration files

## TensorFlow Hub

In order to use [TensorFlow Hub](https://github.com/tensorflow/hub), install it using e.g.

```bash
pip install tensorflow-hub
```

When initializing a Conda environment from `environment.yaml`, this is
already taken care of.
